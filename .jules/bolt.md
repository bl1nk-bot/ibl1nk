## 2026-05-15 - Reusing DOM Nodes for HTML Parsing

**Learning:** Calling `document.createElement('div')` repeatedly inside loop callbacks (like `.map`, `.filter`, or Fuse.js indexing `getFn`) is highly expensive and creates significant performance bottlenecks due to repeated DOM allocation. Furthermore, misusing the comma operator directly in `getFn` can result in empty strings.
**Action:** When extracting plain text from HTML, allocate a single `document.createElement('div')` outside of loops and re-use it (e.g., modifying its `innerHTML` and reading `textContent`) rather than constantly instantiating new elements.
