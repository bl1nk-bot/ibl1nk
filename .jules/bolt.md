## 2024-05-30 - Avoid dynamic imports in hot path DB operations
**Learning:** Dynamic imports for operators like `or`, `and`, `gte` inside frequent database query functions (e.g., `getCharacterRelationships`, `getWritingProgressForUser`) can create measurable overhead due to module resolution in hot paths.
**Action:** Always prefer static top-level imports for database query operators in files handling core database operations.
