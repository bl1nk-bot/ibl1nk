## 2026-05-15 - Reusing DOM Nodes for HTML Parsing

**Learning:** Using `DOMParser` prevents security issues from executing scripts. Using `.innerHTML` on a created `div` does not escape meta-characters and leaves the code vulnerable to XSS.
**Action:** Use `new DOMParser().parseFromString(html, "text/html")` instead of `element.innerHTML` when extracting text securely.

**Learning:** Calling `document.createElement('div')` repeatedly inside loop callbacks (like `.map`, `.filter`, or Fuse.js indexing `getFn`) is highly expensive and creates significant performance bottlenecks due to repeated DOM allocation. Furthermore, misusing the comma operator directly in `getFn` can result in empty strings.
**Action:** When extracting plain text from HTML, allocate a single `document.createElement('div')` outside of loops and re-use it (e.g., modifying its `innerHTML` and reading `textContent`) rather than constantly instantiating new elements.
## 2026-05-16 - Module Resolution Overhead with Dynamic Imports

**Learning:** Dynamic imports inside frequently executed functions (e.g., `await import("drizzle-orm")` inside database query functions) cause performance bottlenecks and unnecessary module resolution overhead on every invocation.
**Action:** Use top-level static imports instead of dynamic imports for libraries like `drizzle-orm` in frequently called functions to avoid runtime module resolution latency.
